# Advanced Keylogger


This is a Keylogger program written in python.

## About

Once the program is run it actually records all the key stocks pressed in that perticular computer and stores then in a file named "logger.txt".

This program also records the clipboard data into a file named "clipboard_data.txt".

All the files are automatically sent to the given e-mail address after the program is terminated.

If 'esc' key is pressed the program will terminate, again that can be customized.
